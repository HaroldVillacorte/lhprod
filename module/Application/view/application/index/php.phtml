<h6>Rapid prototyping</h6>
<p>Php is the perfect tool for rapid prototyping.  Combined with a front end framework like Zurb Foundation or Twitter Bootstrap prototyping an application will be much faster and more meaningful than prototyping in pure html.  Templates can be instantly developed and reused in the view layer of a php framework or converted to a cms theme or template.  Php prototypes can also be easily developed into full fledged applications although using a framework is always recommended.</p>

<h6>Codeigniter</h6>
<p>The MVC framework of choice for developers who love simplicity, performance, and portability.  It is very stable, mature, and is the go to framework for many php developers.  Out of the box it provides a prebuilt and preconfigured MVC architecture and access to well written libraries allowing developers to focus on application specific code instead of rewriting code that has already been written many times over.  Codeigniter's database abstraction library, Active Record, provides a modified implementation of the active record design pattern along with drivers for MySql, PostgreSQL, and SQLite.  But what really sets Codeigniter apart from other frameworks is its documentation, which ships with the framework.  Every aspect of Codeigniter configuration and development is clearly explained and just about all the native methods are documented and working code samples are provided.</p>
<p>There have been many open source projects built on top of the Codeigniter framework.  Most notable among them are Expression Engine, FuelCMS, and PyroCMS.  They each provide basic content management, user management, a templating system, and a module management system.  A major advantage of using any of these systems is that they can easily be extended by any developer who is familiar with the Codeigniter framework using familiar design patterns and code.  Both Codeigniter and Expression Engine are provided by <a href="http://ellislab.com/" title="Ellis Lab" target="_blank">EllisLab</a>.</p>

<h6>Zend Framework 2</h6>
<p>Backed by the <a href="http://zend.com/" title="Zend" target="_blank">Zend Technologies</a>, Zend Framework 2 is a popular choice for enterprise level php development.  The earlier version of the framework, Zend Framework 1, is the most widely used of all the php frameworks out there and powers some very popular and robust systems like Magento and Concrete5.  ZF2 supports Composer for installation and dependency management and follows the PSR-0 specification making it very interoperable with other frameworks such as Symfony 2.</p>
<p>ZF2 requires a server with Php 5.3 to run and access to php settings may be necessary for Composer support.  If the proposed production environment is known to support ZF2 then it should be the first choice for a development platform.  In addition to having access to an extensive library of community developed and tested components and services, both the framework and the community highly encourages all best practices and modern design patterns.  This ultimately will result in an application codebase the is stable, testable, and highly maintainable.</p>
<p>One of the highlights of the ZF2 framework is the Event Manager.  It provides a system where any module can declare events anywhere in the code execution and any other module in the system can attach callback functions to that event.</p>

<h6>Drupal 7</h6>
<p>Drupal is often referred to as a "framework" as opposed to a "content management system."  If we are to compare Drupal to other legacy systems like Wordpress and Joomla then the point is valid, Drupal will be relatively better suited to jobs other than managing content.  However compared to systems that are built on top of frameworks, like say for example, Expression Engine, one might have to come to the conclusion that it is best to limit the use of Drupal to managing content.</p>
<p>If managing content is the job then Drupal is an excellent choice.  Drupal 7 along with its Views module provides a powerful system to manage any kind of content.  Whether it is news articles, blog posts, forums, images, or videos, Drupal provides the system to store and deliver content without writing any code.</p>
<p>Drupal 7 is the final iteration of Drupal's legacy codebase as version 8 will be built on top of Symfony 2 components.  The new version is moving away from being a pure CMS to being a standardized platform for developing web based software.  The planned release for Drupal 8 is September 2013.</p>
